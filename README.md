# Responsive Layout Mock Portfolio
This was a very early-stage project in the Team Treehouse [Front-End Web Development Tech Degree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development) program. I completed the program in 2019. [View my Certificate](https://www.credential.net/1700e85d-d29e-493d-a28e-a8c1860459c8#acc.PS7ITKNb)

## Optimizations

- Use grid or flexbox in the CSS
- Use Bootstrap or other CSS framework for faster development time
- Implement Javascript to add interactive elements
- Use Javascript to add a copyright date that is always correct in the footer
- check the font colors for contrast, gray text on a white background might be problematic

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to output the scrolling gif for this README using a command-line tool: [ffmpgeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). The one you see above is my first GIF generated this way. I would like to get a little smoother with my scrolling.
